# Auto MyQ HubSpace

A simple app to show if Garage Door via MyQ and Front Door via HubSpace are locked/unlocked.

Admittedly, this is probably a very limited application for others. There is probably a developer 
out there who could make this app more configurable for more locks and smart-lock services. For me, 
this is what I wanted and it works. Happy developing.
